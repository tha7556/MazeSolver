# MazeSolver
Maze solver for csc 380: algorithms

An instance of a runner object seeks to reach the end of the maze. Three different objects use three different algorithms to solve four different mazes of increasing size, fifty times each for a total of two-hundred runs. The objective is to evaluate the complexity of each algorithmâ€™s ability to solve the maze based on amount necessary steps vs. the actual solution path step-sum.
